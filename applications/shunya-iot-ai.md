## Hardware Security Element
* The community is concerned about devices that can be easily hacked, specifically by copying their swarm_key files. Applications should include plan for how the devices will be secured, potentially including:

* Are you using an ECC608. Yes or no?
  *  **Yes.**
* Encrypted/locked-down firmware. Yes or no? 
  *  **No.**
* Encrypted storage of the miner swarm_key, either via disk encryption or hardware measures. Yes or No?
  *  **No, using ECC608 for miner swarm_key**
* Encrypted buses, potting and other anti-tampering measures. Yes or No?
  *  **No.**
* Willingness to submit a prototype for audit, and sharing those audit results publicly (pass or fail) Yes or No?
  *  **Yes.**

## Hardware Information
* Which security (swarm) element are you using? 
  *  **ECC608.**
* Which LoRa chipset are you planning to use in your gateway? (ie SX1302/03 & SX1250s or SX1301/08 & SX1255/57) 
  *  **SX1302/03**
* Where are you sourcing your components from? 
  *  **We are sourcing the components from China. We have a dedicated distributor for the components and they are also the partner (stake) in BrainyMiner. Our partner will ensure availability of the components till Q2 of 2022.**
* How many radio modules/ concentrators can you procure?
  *  TBD  

## Manufacturing Information
* Have you built and delivered radio hardware products before?
  *  **No**
* Have you built gateways before? 
  *  **Yes, we have built Industrial IoT Gateways.**
* How many gateways did you make? 
  *  TBD 
* If you have not built gateways before, are you using a third party manufacturer? This is the single largest risk with most hardware ventures. If possible please provide information about your manufacturing partners and supply chain.
  *  TBD 

## Proof of Identity
Per typical KYC/AML procedures, proof of identity for major shareholders (25%+ ownership) will be expected to be provided privately to representatives from Helium Inc or DeWi board members. This will be attested and publicly confirmed by those representatives, e.g. as GitHub comments.
Contact details for this will be provided after your application is submitted on GitHub. 

## Budget & Capital
* How many hotspots are you planning to manufacture and sell within the first six months of sales?
  *  **3000 hotspots**
* How much money will be required up-front? How much money do you have on-hand, and how much do you have access to? 
  *  TBD 
* What is your plan for additional financing if required? (This is the second biggest risk in new hardware ventures - getting almost over the line and then running out of cash.)
  *  TBD  

## Risks & Challenges
Please tell us about some of the challenges that would prevent these products from becoming a reality and how you might address them.
1.  Component Availability 
    -  **Due to the pandemic there is a shortage of components (CPU's and LoRA hardware), it is expected that the shortage will continue till mid 2022. In order to reduce the risk and ensure component availiablity we have onboarded the component distributor as a partner on the terms that they will ensure availability till Q2 of 2022.** 
2.  Radio Certifications
    -  TBD
